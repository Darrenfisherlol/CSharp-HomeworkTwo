/* To Do:
 *
 You will be creating an application to help our sales associates sell our main products, cogs and 
gears.  Cogs have a whole sale price of $79.99 and gears have a whole sale price 
of $250.00.  When our sales associates are selling to our customers on the floor, we have a 
standard 15% markup on our wholesale price for our sales price.  However, if the customer 
purchases more than 10 of either item or a combined quantity of 16 items we only markup the 
items by 12.5%.  On top of this, the sales tax for all sales is 8.9%.
Create a console application that will prompt the sales associate for the number of 
cogs, the number of gears  as well as their Customer ID for a sales order.  Once the user has 
input all of the data needed, create a new instance of the Receipt (or a new Receipt object), call 
the PrintReceipt method on the object and then store it in some sort of collection.  Then you 
should ask if there is another order that needs to be placed and repeat the process of order entry.
After all orders are entered, give the user options to either print all receipts based off of a 
CustomerID, print all receipts for the day, or print the receipt for the sale that had the highest 
total.  Keep prompting the user to see if they would like to perform another function until they 
indicate that they do not.
